# 🌾 Sarii - A Farm-to-Table Marketplace 🌾

Welcome to **Sarii**, a community-driven farm-to-table e-commerce platform proudly built to connect **farmers and consumers** directly, with a little help from the Department of Agriculture! 💚

Sarii makes it easy for the DA to manage market listings and for customers to buy fresh, local produce straight from the source. 🧑‍🌾🥬🍅
